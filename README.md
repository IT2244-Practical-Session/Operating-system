# 🐧 Introduction to Linux and Fedora

Welcome to this repository dedicated to helping you get started with **Linux**, with a focus on the **Fedora** distribution.

## 📘 What is Linux?

**Linux** is an open-source, Unix-like operating system kernel that powers many systems around the world—from smartphones to supercomputers. Distributions like Fedora, Ubuntu, Debian, and Arch are built on top of the Linux kernel to offer complete operating systems.

## 🎯 Why Fedora?

**Fedora** is a cutting-edge Linux distribution sponsored by Red Hat. It emphasizes innovation, free software, and frequent updates, making it an excellent choice for both beginners and developers.

### Key Features of Fedora:
- 💡 Latest open-source technologies
- 🧩 GNOME desktop environment by default
- 🛡️ Strong security features like SELinux
- 📦 DNF package manager
- 🧪 Upstream-first philosophy
